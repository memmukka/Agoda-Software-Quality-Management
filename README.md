# Agoda-Software-Quality-Management

This project is about software quality management for Agoda, which is an online travel booking platform. The goal of this project is to analyze possible quality problems in the system and show how they can be managed in a structured way.

The analysis focuses on important parts of the system such as hotel search, booking, payment, refunds and user accounts. These parts were chosen because they are the main functions that users depend on when using the platform.

The purpose of this project is to improve system reliability, reduce defects, protect user information, and make sure the system performs well, especially during busy periods. Since Agoda handles payments and personal data, good software quality is very important.

This project uses the ISO 25010 quality model to evaluate key quality areas like functionality, performance, reliability, usability, and security. It also applies CMMI to assess the maturity of the development process and suggest improvements. Risk management is included to identify possible system risks and ways to reduce them.

GitHub is used in this project to track defects and risks and issues are created to simulate how problems would be managed in a real software project and a project board is used to show workflow from start to completion.
